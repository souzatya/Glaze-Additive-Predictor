## RESEARCH OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this research project is to accurately predict the amount of carboxy-methyl-cellulose (CMC) and water required to adjust the density and fluidity of brown glaze to production standards of ABI, thus discontinuing the use of Calcium Chloride solution, which is found to decrease the quality of the glaze if added.

Calcium Chloride solution, being a flocculant, helps to decrease fluidity of the glaze very easily without much affecting the density of the glaze and thus is used profoundly as an additive to adjust the parameters of the brown glaze easily at ABI. But, using calcium chloride abundantly, causes devitrification in glaze, meaning, it affects the glossy finish of the glaze, thus, giving the final product a matte finish.

As adding carboxy-methyl-cellulose (CMC), decreases the density and increases the fluidity of the glaze and is also necessary to bind the glaze to the ceramic insulator body, so, we can adjust the density and fluidity of the glaze by accurately predicting and adding the amount of CMC which will eventually let us get the desired parametric outcome. Water will help us to deflocculate the glaze, if the fluidity is lower than the desired production parameters. Virgin glaze will be used to flocculate the glaze, which will not only decrease the fluidity of the glaze, but will also decrease the density of the glaze, upon addition.

Hence, in this project we are looking to discontinue the use of calcium chloride in the glaze and try to adjust the glaze parameters by using carboxy-methyl-cellulose (CMC) as a binder, virgin glaze and water only.
